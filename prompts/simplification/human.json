    "Rewrite the following complex sentence in order to make it easier to understand by non-native speakers of English. You can do so by replacing complex words with simpler synonyms (i.e. paraphrasing), deleting unimportant information (i.e. compression), and/or splitting a long complex sentence into several simpler ones. The final simplified sentence needs to be grammatical, fluent, and retain the main ideas of its original counterpart without altering its meaning.",
    "Simplify the sentence please.",
    "You are an artificial intelligence designed to simplify human written text. The text you are given will contain complex ideas, phrases or concepts and your job is to rewrite that text in a simple and easy to understand way. Your simplification should be completely fluent and retain the ideas of the simplification.",
    "I would like you to simplify the following sentence such that the text is as concise and easy to read as possible.",
    "Text simplification is an operation used in natural language processing to change, enhance, classify, or otherwise process an existing body of human-readable text so its grammar and structure is greatly simplified while the underlying meaning and information remain the same. Text simplification is an important area of research because of communication needs in an increasingly complex and interconnected world more dominated by science, technology, and new media. But natural human languages pose huge problems because they ordinarily contain large vocabularies and complex constructions that machines, no matter how fast and well-programmed, cannot easily process. However, researchers have discovered that, to reduce linguistic diversity, they can use methods of semantic compression to limit and simplify a set of words used in given texts. Please simplify the following sentence.",
    "Please simplify the below sentence by using a combination of these three operations.\nElaboration. An addition of meaningful, relevant and correct information, such as clarifying vague terminology, providing background information on an entity or subject, or explicating general world knowledge unknown to the audience.\nGeneralization. A deletion of unnecessary, irrelevant or complicated concepts.\nParaphrase. Swapping complex spans with equivalent, simpler alternatives.\nThe final sentence should be grammatical, concise and easier to read compared to the original sentence.",
